              "We present BioDINO-Edge, an adaptive dual-foundation framework for accurate few-shot plant pathology on resource-constrained hardware. It combines two complementary foundation models: DINOv2 Small and BioCLIP ViT-B/16. Introduces Purified Taxonomic Domain Synthesis and Regularized Fisher-Discriminant Alignment with analytical Ledoit-Wolf covariance shrinkage. BioDINO-Edge reaches 98.72% peak accuracy on PlantVillage and 83.61% on PlantDoc in-the-wild (+13.0% over SOTA).",
